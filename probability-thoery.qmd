# Introduction to Probability Theory and Random Variables

This section will introduce probability theory and its relevance to machine learning.

## Simulating Dice Rolls in R

We can simulate rolling a die to illustrate the concept of a random variable.

```{r}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Simulate rolling a six-sided die 1000 times
dice_rolls = sample(1:6, size = 1000, replace = TRUE)

# Display the first few roll results
head(dice_rolls)

# Create a table of roll frequencies
roll_frequency = table(dice_rolls)

# Print the roll frequencies
roll_frequency
